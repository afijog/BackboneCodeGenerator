#BackboneCodeGenerator

##StarUML template for generating backbone.js code


###Why should I use this template?
Do you want to save some time when developing your backbone application? I guess so. Run the template and get a basic implementation of the classes of the UML model as backbone javascript files.

Added to this, you can avoid errors such as typos and provide a uniform styling code for your application.

Finally, if you are a serious backend developer, dig into the fun world of javascript. If you are a happy javascript developer, join the amazing world of UML design.


###What will I exactly get?
Run the code generator template under StarUML and you will get some of the basic files you need to start coding your backbone application. Namely, a model, a collection and two views (one for each).

###How can I install it?
Create a folder under your ${STARUML_INSTALL_FOLDER}\modules\staruml-generator\templates and copy the following files:
* template.cot
* template description.tdf

And you are done! :)

###How to generate code?
Follow these steps:
* Create or open your UML model in StarUML
* Go to menu 'Tools' and click the 'StarUML Generator...' option
* Select the Backbone Code Generator template
* Pick your destination folder for the files and press 'Generate'
